text = '''In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed 
    instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part 
    of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs between 
    operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. 
    Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing 
    resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. 
    In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of 
    its variables at any given time.'''
